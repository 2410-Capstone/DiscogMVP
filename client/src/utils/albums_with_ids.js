      'Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA).  Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band\'s bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record "Hit The Lights" for subsequent re-pressings of "Metal Massacre" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].  Metallica\'s debut LP, "Kill \'Em All", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by "Ride The Lightning".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released "Master Of Puppets", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band\'s new bassist and he made his debut on 1987\'s "Garage Days Re-Revisited", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length "...And Justice For All" followed in 1988, featuring the track "One" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.  In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as "The Black Album", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.  In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album "Load".  The following year, "Reload" appeared which had the similiar formula as \'\'Load\'\'. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called "S&M", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.  In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called "St. Anger", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, "St. Anger" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.  In 2008, "Death Magnetic", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica\'s return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton\'s father appeared on Cliff\'s behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.  Winner of 9 Grammy Awards: - Best Metal Performance for One on [m=6571] - Best Metal Performance for Stone Cold Crazy on [m=63484] - Best Metal Performance for [m=6651] - Best Metal Performance for Better Than You on [m=8879] - Best Hard Rock Performance for Whiskey In The Jar on [m=26984] - Best Rock Instrumental Performance for The Call Of Ktulu on [m=8928] - Best Metal Performance for St. Anger on [m=6607] - Best Metal Performance for My Apocalypse on [m=8956] - Best Metal Performance for 72 Seasons on [m=3054827]',

      'Founded in London in July 1967 (by ex-[url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Mayall+%26+The+Bluesbreakers]Bluesbreakers[/url] members, Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood), "Peter Green\'s Fleetwood Mac" instantly became a major force in the UK blues scene, along with their eponymous first album. Following "Mr. Wonderful" & "Then Play On" the driving force of Peter Green had deteriorated as he lapsed into a personal crisis by 1970.

      'Skinny Puppy was a Canadian band with members [a=cEvin Key] (keyboards, percussion) and [a=Nivek Ogre] (vocals), founded in late 1982 in Vancouver, BC. They got a contract at [l=Nettwerk] via the demo tape "Back And Forth" and released their first EP "Remission" in 1984. Their records were released in Europe by [l1792].  They released their first LP "Bites" in 1985, now with member [a=Wilhelm Schroeder] (better known as [a=Bill Leeb]) on keyboards. In 1986, Schroeder was replaced on keyboards by [a=Dwayne R. Goettel] (then in the group [a=Psyche (2)]). Over a career spanning 20+ years and as many releases, Skinny Puppy has remained fresh and vital to its many fans, and is considered as one of the most important bands in the industrial/gothic/ebm genre, inspiring such acts as [a=Nine Inch Nails] and [a=Marilyn Manson].  Skinny Puppy disbanded for a time, following the death of Goettel by overdose in August 1995. Their final album "The Process" was completed and released in early 1996, and quickly became a bridge that earned the band many new fans. After a 5 year absence, they reformed in 2000 for a one-off concert appearance at the Doomsday festival in Dresden, Germany (which has since been released as Back And Forth, Vol. 5 in 2001). The first studio album since their reformation "The Greater Wrong Of The Right" was released after years of anticipation in 2004. They embarked on a worldwide tour in support, and a DVD has been released documenting the North American leg. 2007 saw the release of "Mythmaker", and in 2011 the band released its final album with label SPV, "hanDover". They signed with Metropolis Records in 2012, and released the live album "Bootlegged, Broke And In Solvent Seas". The band released their 12th studio album "Weapon" on May 28, 2013.  They had two final legs of tours in 2023 with their final date December 5th where they announced the break up and Ogre destroyed the band mascot "Cedric".',

      'Industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN and stylized as NIИ) was formed in 1988 by [a27457] in Cleveland, Ohio. Reznor has served as the main producer, singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, and sole member of Nine Inch Nails for 28 years. This changed in December 2016 when [a259284] officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band. In 2020, Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.',

      'The group was formed in New Cross, south-east London in late 1981. All unemployed, and with listening tastes ranging from soul to classical music, they searched out whatever they could find to make music with, and for the most part this consisted of scrap metal salvaged from waste ground and derelict factories. The reason had as much to do with lack of money as it had to do with a dislike for conventional rock instruments. Originally, they used bass guitars and other conventional instruments, but these were fairly rapidly dropped as they obtained more industrial percussion, and found that these created a stronger and more consistent sound. They also, probably later on, gained the rights for some of their music and can been seen listed as copyright holders on some re-issues. Some examples can be seen on the [l=Test Dept.] page.   ',

      'Ministry is the brainchild of [a86726]. Beginning in 1981, playing synth-pop with a strong disco influence, they released their first 12" on [l953], before being signed to [l362] and releasing their debut "[m=7612]," in 1983. After a falling out with the label and the direction of the project, Jourgensen returned to [l953] to release a series of 12" Singles, including "[m=213065]," which became an instant club favorite and would go on to become one of the band\'s most popular songs.  Jourgensen then signed to [l27031]/[l1000] in 1985. Ministry\'s second album "[m=16563]," was produced by [a4969], and had a more menacing sound reflecting Jourgensen\'s interest in the international EBM (electronic body music) scene of the time. Ministry\'s third album, "[m=7643]," (1988), was both a natural evolution of their aesthetic and a sharp break with previous pop tendencies and, with the arrival of [a100041] and other new members, Ministry\'s sound developed into a crossover between EBM, industrial, and heavy metal. Their experimentation with heavy metal was then continued with the following "[m=7332]," (1989), where the guitar began to take on much more importance to their sound. Ministry\'s breakthrough album, "[m=7376]," (1992), was a very dark, powerful, and violent album, that saw the band moving further into thrash metal while still retaining elements of industrial music and noise. The following records "[m=7396]," (1996), and "[m=7510]," (1999), showcased a much more straightforward heavy metal sound, to lower sales than previous records. The band released their first best of collection entitled "[m=292713]," (2001), and were then dropped by [l1000].  In 2003, the band then moved to [l36259] and released "[m=7543],". [a100041] left the band in January 2004, leaving Jourgensen to put together a new line-up for "[m=16549]." After the 2004 "Evil Doer Tour," there was yet another change in personnel with [a68599] founder [a185073] on guitar and [a22534] (who had also played in Prong and in [a=Killing Joke]) on bass. In May, 2006, Ministry released "[m=16269]," which was quickly followed by what was announced as their final album, "[m=16284]," in 2007, and a collection of covers entitled "[m=7414]," in 2008.   Despite Jourgensen\'s claim that the band was over, 2010 saw another collection, mixing covers and remixes, entitled "[m=493113]." Following a serious illness, [a86726] decided to re-start the band with [a264545] and two new Ministry albums followed, "[m=422618]," in 2012 and "[m=595839]," in 2013. Scaccia\'s death in 2012 had apparently brought a final, definite end to the band with the 2013 album, until early 2017 when Jourgensen began working on a new album, tentatively titled "AmeriKKKant."',

      'Rammstein (German pronunciation: [ˈʁamʃtaɪn]) is a German rock band, formed in 1994 in Berlin. Since its formation, Rammstein\'s six-man lineup has remained unchanged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver "Ollie" Riedel, drummer Christoph "Doom" Schneider and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz.  Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German/Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990\'s where industrial rock and (groove) metal were mixed in a vein that became known as [b]NDH[/b], [i]Neue Deutsche Härte[/i] (lit. New German Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like  [a25404], [a36932] and [a12209], but also metal bands like [a85885] and [a34058]. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein\'s award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music [i]Tanz Metal[/i] ("Dance Metal").  There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative years 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in [a271460]\'s tour bus, and someone wrote [i]Rammstein Flugschau[/i] ("Rammstein Air Show") on the wall. [b]Ramstein Air Base[/b] outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident during an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, like [i]Milch[/i] (Milk), [i]Erde[/i] (Earth) and [i]Mutter[/i] (Mother), but the misspelt [i]Rammstein[/i] stuck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and story.   Members: Till Lindemann – lead vocals, harmonica Richard Z. Kruspe – lead guitar, keyboard, backing vocals Paul Landers – rhythm guitar, backing vocals Oliver Riedel – bass Christian Lorenz – keyboard, samples, synthesizers Christoph Schneider – drums, percussion',

      'Front 242 were formed in Aarschot, Belgium, by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen in 1981. Together they produced the first single "Principles / Body To Body" (released Oct \'81). Jean-Luc De Meyer (vocals) and Patrick Codenys (synth) were looking for support from Daniel to complete the first single in thier project "Under Viewer". Daniel offered them to work on the second single "U.Men / Ethics" (released Apr. \'82) and on Front 242. Richard Jonckheere (Richard 23) - not yet an official member of the group - already had a small singing part in the song "U.Men". The first album "Geography" followed in Dec \'82. Richard 23 was increasingly integrated into the group, especially because of his presence on stage. In contrast, Richard criticized the lack of this imposing presence in Dirk. Dirk then taked over management, but then leaved the band in April \'83.   With this line-up, the band released many albums of EBM, gaining more popularity with every release (EBM stands for Electronic Body Music, a term first used on their album "No Comment" appearing on the inner sleeve but not used as or considered as a genre name yet. The term was actually established as a genre through a marketing concept by promoter [a=Jens-Markus Wegener]. It was strongly pushed to German media to promote the SPV compilation [m11378] in 1987/1988. Sometimes the term itself is also credited to Kraftwerk from an interview in 1978, but according to Wegener the Kraftwerk reference wasn’t known at that time neither to him nor Front 242.). They also established a solid live reputation, with an energetic show in para-military outfits. The year 1993 brought a radical change in style, with guest musicians, the disappearance of their military look and the exploration of both harder (guitar samples) and softer (female vocals, ambient) sounds. After many years of silence, except for a few live/remix-albums, Front 242 re-appeared in the spotlight in the late nineties with their Re:boot-tour, bringing modern, techno-like cover versions of their own songs. In 2003 they took a step back towards their EBM-roots, with the release of "Pulse" and "Still & Raw".  Before Front 242, the members were already involved in other projects, like [a148769] ([a43841]), [a217080] ([a92674] & [a43842]) and Tranik Ind. ([a232851]).',

After they split, Genesis and Peter formed [a=Psychic TV] (and Peter later joining [a=Coil]) and Chris and Cosey becoming, well, [a=Chris & Cosey]. They came back together 23 years later in 2004 to plan an ill-fated weekend festival, which became a one-off recording session in London when the festival fell through, releasing a limited TGNOW album of the recordings.  A series of new releases and remasters followed as well as live performances. In 2010, Genesis withdrew from touring with TG and the three other members renamed themselves [a=X-TG]. However, Peter\'s death in November that year brought an end to TG/XTG for good. One final release, released under the name X-TG, followed in 2012.

      'Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA).  Metallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [a251874] and drummer [a251550].  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “[m=63482]”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist [a648330].  Afterwards, [a509874] became the band\'s bassist and [a251808] joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record "Hit The Lights" for subsequent re-pressings of "Metal Massacre" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by [a364982], which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].  Metallica\'s debut LP, "Kill \'Em All", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by "Ride The Lightning".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released "Master Of Puppets", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, [a390503] (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band\'s new bassist and he made his debut on 1987\'s "Garage Days Re-Revisited", an EP of cover tunes.  The full-length "...And Justice For All" followed in 1988, featuring the track "One" which was chosen as the subject for their first promotional music video.  In 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as "The Black Album", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.  In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album "Load".  The following year, "Reload" appeared which had the similiar formula as \'\'Load\'\'. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called "S&M", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.  In 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called "St. Anger", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, "St. Anger" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.  In 2008, "Death Magnetic", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica\'s return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton\'s father appeared on Cliff\'s behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.  Winner of 9 Grammy Awards: - Best Metal Performance for One on [m=6571] - Best Metal Performance for Stone Cold Crazy on [m=63484] - Best Metal Performance for [m=6651] - Best Metal Performance for Better Than You on [m=8879] - Best Hard Rock Performance for Whiskey In The Jar on [m=26984] - Best Rock Instrumental Performance for The Call Of Ktulu on [m=8928] - Best Metal Performance for St. Anger on [m=6607] - Best Metal Performance for My Apocalypse on [m=8956] - Best Metal Performance for 72 Seasons on [m=3054827]',

      'Trumpeter, bandleader, composer, and one of the most important figures in jazz music history, and music history in general. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.  Born: 26 May 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA. Died: 28 September 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65).  Best known for his seminal modern jazz album "[m=5460]" (1959), the highest selling jazz album of all time with six million copies sold.  Miles went to New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948 Miles Davis started his own ensembles. At that time he met [a=Gil Evans], who contributed to [a497768]\'s scores and arrangements. From the few recordings they made in 1949 and 1950 came the album "[m=62308]" (1957), with Davis and Evans going on to work more together in the future.  Miles Davis was a prominent musician in the creation of \'Hard Bop\' style in the mid-1950s. In the late 1960s he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. In the mid-1970s he went on a hiatus because of various health and personal problems, though he made a comeback in 1980.  Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 (Performer).

      "Austrian composer and conductor. Born 7 July 1860 in Kalischt, Bohemia (today Kaliště, Czech Republic) and died 18 May 1911 in Vienna, Austria.  Gustav Mahler (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʊstaf ˈmaːlɐ]; was a late-Romantic Austrian-Bohemian composer and one of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 the music was discovered and championed by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.  Born in humble circumstances, Mahler showed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism from Judaism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of [a=Richard Wagner] and [a=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's [a=The Metropolitan Opera] and [a=The New York Philharmonic Orchestra]. He wed fellow composer and musician [a=Alma Mahler-Werfel] on 9 March 1902. They had two daughters, Maria Anna Mahler (03.11.1902-05.07.1907) & [a=Anna Mahler].  Mahler's œuvre is relatively small—for much of his life composing was a part-time activity, secondary to conducting—and is confined to the genres of symphony and song, except for one piano quartet. Most of his ten symphonies are very large-scale works, several of which employ soloists and choirs in addition to augmented orchestral forces. These works were often controversial when first performed, and were slow to receive critical and popular approval; an exception was the triumphant premiere of his Eighth Symphony in 1910. Mahler's immediate musical successors were the composers of the Second Viennese School, notably [a=Arnold Schoenberg], [a=Alban Berg] and [a=Anton Webern]. [a=Dmitri Shostakovich] and [a=Benjamin Britten] are among later 20th-century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler. The International Gustav Mahler Institute was established in 1955, to honour the composer's life and work.",

      'The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with [a=Charlie Daniels] joined by [a=Barry Barnes] (guitar), [a=Mark Fitzgerald] (bass), [a=Fred Edwards] and [a=Gary Allen] (drums), and [a=Taz DiGregorio] (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style "Uneasy Rider", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, "The South\'s Gonna Do It". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.  The Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975\'s Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, "The Mountain Whippoorwill", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into "The Devil Went Down To Georgia", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.  In 1980 the band recorded "In America" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, "Still In Saigon" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.  During the 90s Daniels updated "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children\'s album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time.',

His ability to fuse rock, pop, R&B, and soul into chart-topping hits set new standards for creativity and performance. Throughout his career, he became a pioneering force in music, influencing countless artists across various genres.

On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he had found Jackson in his room, not breathing and with a barely detectable pulse, and that he administered CPR on Jackson to no avail. After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at 12:21 p.m., Jackson was treated by paramedics at the scene and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.",
